title: "SOS 598: Research Data Management"
description: "This course will provide students with foundations of sound research data management. Upon completion of the course, students will be aware of tools and approaches to effectively manage research data from project inception through publication of both findings and data. Topics include sound data management principles, version control, database concepts, metadata generation, data management plans, research collaboration, and tools for data processing (e.g., spreadsheets, R). This is a hands-on course in which students will perform exercises with sample data and/or their own research data. We strongly recommend that students come prepared with their own laptop computer to maximize the learning experience."

#### texts

The instructors will provide all relevant reading materials. Though not
required, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="\_blank"} is an
excellent companion to the course. R4DS is available in print and in full text
on the author's website.


#### materials

* We will use Git and GitHub extensively throughout the course. Please install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="\_blank"}. Once installed, all Git functionality is available through the command line. However, there are several graphical user interaces (GUIs) available if you are unfamiliar with the command line or simply prefer a GUI. GitHub has its own [desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}, but we recommend and will use the version control functionality provided by  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){:target="\_blank"} for most in-class examples and demonstrations.
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="\_blank"} and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){:target="\_blank"}
* [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/){:target="\_blank"}
* You should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class.
